# Cryptographic Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of five fundamental cryptographic algorithms:

1. **CipherBlockChaining**: Implements the CBC mode of block cipher encryption.
2. **CipherTextOnlyAttack**: Demonstrates a basic attack scenario on ciphertext-only encryption.
3. **DiffieHellman**: Provides a simulation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
4. **DigitalEnvelope**: Shows how to use symmetric encryption wrapped in asymmetric encryption for secure message transmission.
5. **RSA**: Implements the RSA algorithm for public key encryption and decryption.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in Java and can be used for educational purposes to understand the principles and workings of these cryptographic techniques.
